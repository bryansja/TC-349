<h1>James Bryans</h1>
<h2>Telecommunicaton: Interactive and Social Media</h2>
<h2>About Me and My Experience with Programming</h2>
<p>My name is James Bryans.  I am a Telecommunication major at  <a href="http://msu.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan State University</a>.  I am 22 years old and live in Canton, MI.  Some of my favorite hobbies are to play golf and run. Last year for golf I qualified for the US Junior Amateur which was a pretty awesome experience.</p>
<p>I have a good amount of experience with html, css, javascript, and python.  I am not familiar with using terminal but with the Internet and videos I was able to get a grasp of it.  To create webpages I usually use Aptana Studio and Dreamweaver which is pretty close to textmate.</p>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>
<p>Mostly do my development in a quite room in my house.  I like the quite because it helps me to think better.  When marking up my site I do not mind having some music on, but not to loud.  I also like the room to be a well lite.  Keeping me awake and active.</p>  

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The hardware that I use is a 13" Retina MacBook Pro running OS X Mavericks and a 15" HP Pavilion Dv6000 running windows 8.  It is nice having two computers cause it is easier for me to follow along with example videos on the HP while writing code on my Mac.</p>

<h2>Like to work</h2>
<p>I like to work on web development project by first drawing out a couple rough sketches and getting a few wireframes together.  After that I like to pick the style and color that I want to theme my webpage.  After having the wireframe and theme I like to got through and add all of the mark ups that I think I am going to need.  After that I start adding the content to my webpage and watch it form into a similar layout as my wireframe.</p>
